* NixOS
This is my shitty NixOS config. I will be doing at least a whole year on NixOS, started late on 1/15/26. I have used NixOS for short periods of time, 1-3 months in the past.

* Programs

| Window Manager  | Niri           |
| Top bar         | Noctalia-shell |
| Text editor     | Doom Emacs     |
| Terminal        | Kitty          |

* Install

*NOT MEANT TO BE USED BY OTHERS*, so use at your own discretion

To install run the following command in the root dir of the project
#+begin_src bash
nix run --extra-experiemntal-features 'nix-command flakes' ./install#
#+end_src
